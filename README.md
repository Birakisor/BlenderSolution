Questions:
1. Write a script in Blender to create a new material which uses textures from local
storage and apply it to selected mesh objects.
2. Write a script in Blender that can find out the name of the main object's parent
and list the names of all its children, no matter how many levels deep they are in
the hierarchy.
3. Create a Blender plugin that fetches data of selected objects and stores it in a
JSON file in local storage. Data should include location, rotation(in degrees), scale,
parent name if any, and children count.
4. Write a blender plugin to export models in other formats. Allow users to specify
the export path and file format (e.g., .obj, .fbx).
